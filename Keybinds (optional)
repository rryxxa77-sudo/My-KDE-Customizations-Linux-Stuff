These are optional keybinds which can be a life-changer when got into it
You can create these by:KDE System settings > Search Shortcuts > Click Create > Add an app or command > Assign it keys and done!

These are my currucent ones:

Super+Arrow Keys (this come when you install kde lifechanger when used)
Super+M to maximize an app
Super+H to Switch between apps
Super+Q to resize an app (Extremly easy to resize)
Super+E to move an app (Extremly easy to move)

I use kitty terminal which means:I made ctrl + alt + t to Launch Kitty instead of Konsole
You can also make Insert button terminal which is pretty easy (insert is an extremly useless button)
You can also add funny things to Keys and bind them!
